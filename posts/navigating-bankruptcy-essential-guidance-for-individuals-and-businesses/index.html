      <p>Bankruptcy is one of the most significant financial decisions a person or business can make, yet it remains widely misunderstood. Far from being a mark of failure, bankruptcy is a legal mechanism designed to give overwhelmed debtors a pathway to financial recovery while ensuring fair treatment of creditors.</p>
      <p>The United States Bankruptcy Code provides several chapters under which individuals and businesses can file. Chapter 7, often called "liquidation bankruptcy," allows qualifying individuals to discharge most unsecured debts in exchange for the liquidation of non-exempt assets. For many filers, Chapter 7 provides the quickest path to a fresh start, typically completing within 3-6 months.</p>
      <p>Chapter 13, known as "reorganization bankruptcy," allows individuals with regular income to create a 3-5 year repayment plan that addresses their debts while protecting their assets. This option is particularly valuable for homeowners facing foreclosure, as it can halt the process and provide time to catch up on missed mortgage payments.</p>
      <p>For businesses, Chapter 11 provides the framework for restructuring operations while continuing to operate. This complex process allows companies to renegotiate contracts, reduce debts, and emerge as viable entities. While Chapter 11 is most commonly associated with large corporations, small businesses also use this tool, and the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019 streamlined the process for smaller enterprises.</p>
      <p>The bankruptcy process begins with credit counseling from an approved agency, followed by filing a petition with the bankruptcy court. An automatic stay immediately halts most collection actions, providing immediate relief from creditor pressure. The process then varies by chapter, but all require thorough disclosure of financial information and cooperation with the court-appointed trustee.</p>
      <p>Understanding the implications of bankruptcy — including its impact on credit, future borrowing, and in some cases employment and housing — is essential for making an informed decision. While bankruptcy does appear on credit reports for 7-10 years, many filers find that their credit scores begin recovering within 1-2 years of discharge.</p>
